   windowsill) for the phone to acquire a GPS lock.
5. To lock the phone: press the red 'hang up' button, and when prompted do
   not close the tracker.  Press the menu and then '*' button to lock (and 
   repeat to unlock).

   number.

5. If the IMEI number is displayed in the list:

   a. Click edit on it's entry.
   b. Update the callsign and description.
   c. Click save.

6. If the IMEI number is not displayed in the list:

   correct (only callsigns in the normal SJA format will be accepted) and that
   all of the boxes have been filled.

The new callsign should display with 15 minutes.  The old callsign (unless used
by another phone) may take up to an hour to disappear.
